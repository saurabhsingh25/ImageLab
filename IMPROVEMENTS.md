# Potential Codebase Improvements

This document lists possible improvements for the Multi-Image Preprocessing Workbench codebase, focusing on `app/page.tsx` and other key files. These suggestions are intended to further elevate code quality, maintainability, and user experience.

---

## app/page.tsx

### 1. **Feature Parity & Image Processing**
- **Add in-browser support for all transforms:**
  - Implement `sharpen` and `crop` transforms in the browser, not just in the Python export.
  - Use more advanced algorithms for blur (e.g., separable Gaussian kernel) for better performance and accuracy.
- **Support batch processing:**
  - Allow users to upload and process multiple images at once.

### 2. **Code Structure & Maintainability**
- **Component decomposition:**
  - Extract pipeline controls, preview area, and mathematical explanation into separate components for better readability and reusability.
- **Use enums for transform types:**
  - Replace string literals with TypeScript enums for better type safety and maintainability.
- **Adopt useReducer for complex state:**
  - If state logic grows, consider using `useReducer` for pipeline/image state management.

### 3. **Performance**
- **Optimize image processing loops:**
  - Use typed arrays and minimize repeated `getImageData`/`putImageData` calls.
  - Consider offloading heavy processing to Web Workers for smoother UI.

### 4. **Error Handling & User Feedback**
- **Add user feedback for errors:**
  - Show toast notifications for invalid uploads, processing errors, or unsupported file types.
- **Graceful fallback for large images:**
  - Warn users or downscale images that are too large for browser processing.

### 5. **Accessibility & UX**
- **Improve keyboard navigation:**
  - Ensure all controls are accessible via keyboard.
- **Add ARIA labels and roles:**
  - Improve accessibility for screen readers.
- **Disable move up/down buttons appropriately:**
  - Prevent moving the first item up or the last item down in the pipeline.

### 6. **Testing**
- **Add unit and integration tests:**
  - Use Jest/React Testing Library for UI and logic tests.
- **Add E2E tests:**
  - Use Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end user flow testing.

## components/mathematical-explanation.tsx
- **Add prop types and stricter validation** for explanation objects.
- **Support LaTeX rendering** for more complex mathematical formulas.
- **Extract subcomponents** (e.g., kernel visualization, formula display) for clarity.

---

## General Codebase
- **Adopt a consistent code style:**
  - Use Prettier and ESLint with strict rules.
- **Add more granular comments** where logic is non-obvious.
- **Add architectural diagrams** (e.g., in the README or a separate doc).
- **Document all custom hooks and utility functions.**
- **Add CI/CD workflows** for linting, testing, and deployment.

---

## Future Features (Optional)
- **Server-side processing option** (Python backend) for large/complex jobs.
- **User accounts and pipeline saving/sharing.**
- **Plugin system for custom transforms.**
